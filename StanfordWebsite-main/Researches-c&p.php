	<h1>Research Centers & Partners</h1>
	<p>
		The work of HAI is only made possible through collaboration with labs, centers, and institutes across and beyond the Stanford campus, all of which are critical partners in achieving our mission.

	<h2>HAI Centers and Labs</h2>
		<h4><a href="">AI100</a></h4>
		<p>
			The One Hundred Year Study on Artificial Intelligence, or AI100, is a 100-year effort to study and anticipate how the effects of artificial intelligence will ripple through every aspect of how people work, live, and play.

		<h4><a href="">AI Index</a></h4>
		<p>
			The AI Index is an effort to track, collate, distill and visualize data relating to artificial intelligence.  It aspires to be a comprehensive resource of data and analysis for policymakers, researchers, executives, journalists, and the general public to develop intuitions about the complex field of AI.

            “Our vision of immersive care is about endowing human caregivers with ‘superpowers’ — through augmentation, not replacement, to upskill rather than deskill.” Cornell Associate Dean <a href="">@deborahestrin</a> discusses AI in health care during HAI’s spring conference.<a href="">https://stanford.io/31WdkvS</a>

            If a weather report predicts accurate information for the days ahead, do we really need the causal explanation for why? @drnigam professor of medicine at Stanford says the same logic should be applied to algorithms. https://stanford.io/2Q3666D

            Factors like age, pre-existing conditions, and comorbidities might cause doctors to recommend different treatments that could produce worse outcomes. Stanford researchers are using machine learning to help solve this clinical treatment selection bias. https://stanford.io/3mseOHr
