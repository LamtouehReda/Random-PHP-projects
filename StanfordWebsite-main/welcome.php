The scope and scale of impact of the Age of AI will be more profound than any other period of transformation in our history. AI has the potential to radically transform every industry and every society.
<br><br>
If AI is to serve the collective needs of humanity, it must incorporate an understanding of what moves us — physically, intellectually and emotionally. It is critical that we design machine intelligence that can understand human language, feelings, intentions and behaviors, and interact with nuance and in multiple dimensions.
<br><br>
To achieve this, the creators and designers of AI must be broadly representative of humanity. This requires a true diversity of thought — across gender, ethnicity, nationality, culture and age, as well as across disciplines.
<br><br>
Stanford University has a strong tradition of multidisciplinary work and Stanford HAI builds on that legacy. We are bringing together leading thinkers across multiple fields so that we can better prepare future leaders to learn, build, invent and scale with purpose, intention and a human-centered approach.
<br><br>
We are all venturing into a new world that we are building as we go. As creators of this new technology, it is our collective responsibility to guide AI so that it has a positive impact on our planet, our nations, our communities, our families and our lives.
<br><br>
We hope you’ll join us,
<br><br>
Fei-Fei Li and John Etchemendy
Denning Co-Directors of Stanford Institute for Human-Centered AI
