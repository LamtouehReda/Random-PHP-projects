	<p>
Stanford HAI is actively seeking engagement with companies that share our mission to advance AI research, education, policy, and practice to improve the human condition.  Such engagement complements our collaboration with other stakeholders, including academia, policymakers, public sector entities, and NGOs.

Financial support and real-world insights from corporate members help ensure that the Institute has the resources needed to pursue innovative, interdisciplinary research to address the most critical questions about the future of AI and its development.
